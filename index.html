            <h3>Major winter storm in the east</h3>
            <p>Officials are doing their best to keep motorists off blizzard-affected roads in Missouri, where visibility at times has
            been reduced to a quarter-mile and a major roadway has been closed because of snow.
            
            The National Weather Service office for Kansas City, Missouri, warned residents to stay off the roads for all but the
            most urgent needs.
            
            "You may not even be able to get there if you wanted to," it said. "Stay home, stay warm, and stay safe."?</p><hr>

            <h3>Attack in New Orleans on New Years</h3>
            <p>Kim Alexander sat in the middle of the half-filled sanctuary as music and prayer filled the room. While Bishop Lester
            Love spoke of healing and hope at the pulpit, Alexander didn’t seem convinced the city will be safer after a car rampage
            killed 14 New Year’s revelers on Bourbon Street.</p><hr>

            <h3>Biden signs Social Security law before leaving office</h3>
            <p>With the stroke of a pen, two Social Security provisions nationwide have been eliminated, as President Joe Biden signed
            H.R. 82 into law on Sunday, January 5.
            
            H.R. 82 is commonly known as the Social Security Fairness Act of 2023, sponsored by former Louisiana Congressman Garret
            Graves (R-LA-06) and former Virginia Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger (D-VA-07). The Act removes the Windfall
            Elimination Provision (WEP) for retirees and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) for beneficiaries.
            
            The WEP and GPO reduce or eliminate earned benefits for retirees and beneficiaries, which add up to approximately 2.8
            million Americans, according to Graves.</p>
